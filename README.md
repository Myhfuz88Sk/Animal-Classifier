# Animal-Classifier
An image-based machine learning system that classifies animals into different categories using a trained deep learning model. The system can identify animals from images such as cats, dogs, horses, elephants, and more.


Features:

Classifies animal images into multiple categories.

Uses CNN for accurate image-based classification.

Supports custom dataset training and testing.

Includes a web interface for uploading and predicting images (optional).

Project Structure:

├── dataset/ -> Contains training and testing images
├── model/ -> Saved model weights
├── notebooks/ -> Jupyter Notebooks for training and evaluation
├── app/ -> Web app using Flask or Streamlit
├── utils/ -> Helper scripts (data loaders, preprocessors)

Dataset:

You can use any animal image dataset. Example sources include:

Kaggle: Animal Image Datasets

Custom images organized in folders by class (e.g., dog/, cat/, elephant/)

Each class should have its own folder with relevant images.

Tech Stack:

Python

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch

OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas

Flask or Streamlit (for deployment)

Installation:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Animal-Classifier.git

Navigate to the folder:
cd Animal-Classifier

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Training the Model:

You can train the model using the training script or Jupyter notebook inside /notebooks.

Example command:
python train_model.py

Using the App:

To run the web app (Flask or Streamlit):

For Flask:
cd app
python app.py

For Streamlit:
streamlit run app/app.py

Upload an animal image and get the predicted class.

Results:

High accuracy on test set.

Real-time prediction with uploaded images.

Supports adding new animal classes easily.
